PLEASED PROJECT
===============

Plants are able of amazing sensing capabilities: they sense the environment and when subject to stimuli they generate electrical signals.

The PLEASED project is developing a technology to collect and analyze such signals. We aim at using plant communities as distributed, eco-compatible, self-sustainable, cost-effective.

PLEASED KIT
===========

The Pleased Kit is an open-source, user-friendly software/hardware bundle to collect signals for plants. In this way anyone can setup its own experiments and create its own datasheet based on a particular plant's species or on a particular simulus.

The Pleased Kit is based on the Labjack EI-1040 programmable gain instrumentation amplifier and on Labjack U6 Multifunction DAQ with USB. Through the user-friendly GUI written in Python it is possible to setup experiments and to save the acquired data in a reliable. A realtime chart is provided to have a visual perspective of the signal coming from the plant.

More information about installation, experiments setup and data acquisition can be found on our [wiki page](https://github.com/pleasedkit/pleased-kit/wiki/Data-Acquisition)
